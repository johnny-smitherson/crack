"""Filesystem job queue for the crack worker (no external infra dependency).

Jobs live as JSON files under ``.pi/crack/harness/queue/`` with two subdirs:

- ``pending/``    — enqueued, not yet claimed. Filenames sort chronologically
  (``<ms_epoch>_<uuid8>.json``) so the oldest job is always claimed first.
- ``processing/`` — claimed by the worker, in flight. On a clean completion the
  file is removed; on a crash/restart it is reclaimed back to ``pending/``.

The queue is process- and thread-safe by construction: claiming a job is a
single ``os.rename`` (atomic within a filesystem), so two racing claimers can
never both win the same file — the loser gets ``FileNotFoundError`` and moves on.

Job spec (dict, persisted as the file body)::

    {"id", "task_id", "slug", "step", "form": {...} | None, "enqueued_at", "run_id"?}

The in-memory job dict additionally carries ``_path`` (the processing-file path)
so ``complete`` / ``fail`` can remove the right file.

Dedupe key for exclusive enqueue is ``(task_id, slug, run_id)`` where a missing
``run_id`` matches only other jobs with no ``run_id`` (backward compatible with
stage and chat jobs).
